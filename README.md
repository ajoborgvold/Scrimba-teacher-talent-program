# Scrimba Teacher Talent Program

As part of Scrimba's Teacher Talent Program, I produced a video-based, interactive coding course teaching React.js and web accessibility through building a memory game.

Check out the course on Scrimba where IDE and video-streaming have been merged into one, allowing you to pause the video and edit my code: [Build a Memory Game in React - Scrimba edition](https://scrimba.com/memory-game-in-react-c0a3odsk39)

The course is also available on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel: [Build a Memory Game in React - freeCodeCamp edition](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-memory-game-in-react/)
